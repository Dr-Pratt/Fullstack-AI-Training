Test and modify → Prompt for deeper understanding → Iterate
```

Benefits:
- Faster concept acquisition
- Personalized to your background
- Interactive Q&A
- Multiple perspectives quickly

### 2. Iterative Refinement

Start simple, add complexity:
```
Week 2: Basic REST endpoint
Week 3: + Input validation + Error handling
Week 4: + Authentication + Rate limiting + Caching
```

### 3. Project-Based Consolidation

Every 2-3 weeks: Major project that combines all learned concepts
- Reinforces learning
- Creates portfolio piece
- Simulates real work

### 4. Daily Journaling

Documented reflection:

**Your Transition Story**

Script (customize):
```
"I've spent 15 years in banking technology, progressively moving into
leadership and management roles. While I valued the strategic aspects
and enjoyed leading teams, I found myself missing the creative problem-solving
and the satisfaction of building solutions firsthand.

After deep reflection, I decided to return to hands-on engineering, but with
a modern, AI-first approach. Over the past 4 months, I've intensively retrained:
- Built 10+ projects covering Java/Spring Boot, Node.js, Python, React
- Integrated AI capabilities (Gemini, Claude, RAG systems, autonomous agents)
- Deployed everything to production with CI/CD pipelines
- Achieved 80%+ test coverage across projects
- Created a portfolio at [your-portfolio.com]

What excites me about this role is [specific aspect of the job]. My unique
combination of deep domain expertise in [banking/fintech] and fresh technical
skills allows me to bridge business needs with technical implementation in
ways that pure junior engineers or pure business people cannot.

I'm not just learning to code again—I'm bringing 15 years of understanding
what makes software successful in production environments, combined with
the latest technical capabilities."
```
