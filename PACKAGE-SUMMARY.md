## 📖 How to Read the Training Materials

### ✅ Option 1: Read Markdown Files Directly (RECOMMENDED)

**The markdown files are perfectly readable as-is!**

**On Mac:**
1. Open in **VS Code**:
   - Install VS Code
   - Open folder: `fullstack-ai-training`
   - Open `markdown/FULLSTACK_AI_ENGINEER_TRAINING_PROGRAM.md`
   - Press `Cmd+Shift+V` for preview mode

2. Or use **Marked 2** (paid) or **MacDown** (free):
   - Drag `.md` file to app
   - Beautiful rendering with all links working

**On Windows:**
1. Open in **VS Code**:
   - Same as Mac, but `Ctrl+Shift+V` for preview

2. Or use **Typora** (free trial):
   - Open `.md` files
   - Live preview mode

**Why markdown is better for learning:**
- ✅ Easy to copy-paste code
- ✅ All hyperlinks work
- ✅ Can add personal notes
- ✅ Search within document (Cmd/Ctrl+F)
- ✅ No PDF generation hassle

---

### Option 2: Generate PDFs (Optional)

**Note**: PDF generation requires additional software (LaTeX). Markdown files work great without this!

**If you still want PDFs:**

1. **Install LaTeX** (one-time setup):
   ```bash
   # Mac
   brew install --cask basictex
   # Wait 5-10 minutes for installation
   # Restart terminal, then:
   sudo tlmgr update --self
   sudo tlmgr install collection-fontsrecommended
   ```

2. **Generate PDFs**:
   ```bash
   cd fullstack-ai-training
   ./generate-pdfs.sh
   ```

**If LaTeX installation fails or you don't want it:**
- Just use the markdown files! They're complete and easier to use for coding along.
- Or upload to GitHub - GitHub renders markdown beautifully

---

### Option 3: Upload to GitHub (Great for Portfolio)

1. **Create new repository** on GitHub
2. **Push this folder**:
   ```bash
   cd fullstack-ai-training
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add Full Stack AI Engineer training materials"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin <your-repo-url>
   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. **Read on GitHub**:
   - GitHub renders markdown beautifully
   - All links work
   - Can share progress publicly
   - Shows commitment to learning
