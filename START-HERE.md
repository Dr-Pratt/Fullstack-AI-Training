## 🎓 Learning Philosophy

### Use AI Effectively
- **Gemini**: For learning concepts, explanations, comparisons
- **Claude**: For code generation, debugging, code review
- **Use HOW-TO-USE-AI-WHEN-STUCK.md** as your guide!

### Key Principles
1. **Build while learning** - Don't just read, code along!
2. **Commit daily** - Even small progress counts
3. **Use AI prompts provided** - They're tailored to your background
4. **Journal daily** - Track progress and learnings
5. **Review weekly** - Reflect and adjust

### What Makes This Different
- **AI-first learning** - Gemini and Claude accelerate everything
- **Portfolio-driven** - Every week adds to GitHub
- **Domain-focused** - All examples from banking/fintech
- **Polyglot** - Master 3 backend stacks, not just 1
- **Production-ready** - Deploy everything, not just localhost

3. Use provided AI prompts
4. Complete hands-on exercises
5. Build the weekly project

### HOW-TO-USE-AI-WHEN-STUCK.md
**Use when you encounter:**

- Error you can't fix
- Feature you don't know how to implement
- Code you want reviewed
- Design decision to make

### Daily Journal Template
**Use every day:**
- Copy template
- Fill in as you go (not at end of day)
- Track what worked, what didn't
- Save effective AI prompts
- Review weekly for patterns

### Weekly Checklist
**Use each week:**
- Print or keep digital copy
- Check off tasks as completed
- Review at week's end

## 🆘 Getting Help

### When Stuck on a Concept
1. **First (5-10 min)**: Try to figure it out yourself
2. **Then**: Use AI (see HOW-TO-USE-AI-WHEN-STUCK.md)
3. **Prompt format**:
   ```
   Context: I'm learning [X] in the Full Stack AI Training Program.
   Background: 15 years tech management, familiar with [Y].
   Problem: [Specific issue]
   Tried: [What I've attempted]
   Help me understand: [Specific question]
   ```

### When Code Has Errors
1. **Read error message carefully** (often tells you exactly what's wrong)
2. **Google the exact error** (someone else hit it)
3. **Use Claude for debugging** (copy-paste error + code)
4. **Check documentation** (official docs are authoritative)

### When Overwhelmed
1. **This is normal** - You're learning A LOT
2. **Take a break** (walk, coffee, fresh air)
3. **Review progress** (look at your commits, what you've built)
4. **Adjust pace** if needed (better to understand than rush)
5. **Focus on one thing** at a time
